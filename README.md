# 📘 Java Data Structures Course – Round 2  

Welcome to the official repository for the **Java Data Structures Course – Round 2** 🎉.  
This course is another **hands-on journey into data structures with Java**, starting **from zero** with fresh explanations, examples, and exercises.  

Whether you’re just beginning your path or looking for a clean restart, this round is built to give you **solid foundations** step by step.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn  

- 📦 ArrayList – dynamic arrays and internal logic
- 🔗 LinkedList – singly and doubly linked lists
- 🧱 Stack – LIFO behavior with use cases
- 📬 Queue – FIFO, circular queues, and variations
- 🧮 Recursion – single, double, and backtracking
- 🗃️ HashMap & HashSet – map fundamentals
- 🌲 Trees – binary trees, traversals, and BSTs
- 🕸️ Graphs – adjacency list, BFS, DFS, and basic pathfinding
- 🧩 Problem Solving – multiple coding problems for each structure

> 🔧 Each data structure includes:  
> - A **full Java implementation** from scratch  
> - A `main` class for quick testing  
> - A `Problems` class for practice
